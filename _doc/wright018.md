notes: 'Speech written out: My Speech/ Modern School/ Tuesday June 16, 1959/ Graduation/
  Rose Room Auditorium/ Grade Six/ Ballroom/ Candle of Knowledge/ Mildred, parents,
  teachers, Grade 6- Thank you for intitiating us into the fraternity of knowledge
  on your level. We shall light this candle with the pride of learning and achieving-
  as we grow in this knowledge; it is our desire to share it with others, for the
  real essence of knowledge is having and apllying it to some good purpose. This we
  resolve to do, and we look forward three years from now, when we are being graduated.
  This we shall remmember, that It is not important to know (underlined) everything.
  However, it is important to know the value (underlined) of everything- to appreciate
  what we learn, and to apply- what we know. This symbol, this candle of knowledge
  shall ever be the talisman to light our way.'
