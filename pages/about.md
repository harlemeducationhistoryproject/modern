### Credits

The Documenting the Modern School project, which led to this website, started in 2016 with collaboration between Karen D. Taylor, Founder and Executive Director of [While We Are Still Here](https://whilewearestillhere.org/), and [Ansley T. Erickson, Associate Professor of History and Education Policy](https://tc.columbia.edu/faculty/ate11) and Co-Director of the [Harlem Education History Project](https://harlemeducationhistory.org/).

In 2017 and 2019, Teachers College graduate students in a research seminar on Harlem's educational history learned to conduct oral history interviews at a multigenerational reunion organized by Karen D. Taylor, and at later gatherings. Interviewers included Yianella Blanco, Ansley Erickson, Kelsey Hanf, Joshua Heitkamp, Matthew Kautz, Dominique Lester, Laura Montanari, Irene Oujo, Shellina Shidnia, Samantha Reed, and Karen D. Taylor. [Mike Tyner](https://www.tfiny.org/filmmakers/detail/mike_tyner) and Joel Vargas recorded video and sound. John Fleming, Esther Cyna, Damaris Dunn, Barry Goldenberg, Rachel Klepper, and Jean Park worked with Modern School alumni during the multigenerational reunion and later events to make digital copies of their personal collections related to the school, which they chose to contribute to this site. After that gathering, Rachel Klepper edited interview files, Noël Um audited transcripts, and Khadijah Akeem organized and confirmed permissions.

Modern School community members April Bowie, Melanie Edwards, Deidre B. Flowers, Diana Lachatenere, and Cherilyn 'Liv' Wright reviewed interview themes for the 2019 interviews and discussed plans and ideas for this website. Modern School alumni participated in "tagging parties," organized by Khadijah Akeem and with facilitation from Deidre B. Flowers, to develop metadata for the items contained here. Participants included Yvonne Daniel, Melanie Edwards, Diana Lachatanere, Robin Jones, Barbara North, Everard Rutledge, Daphne Skeeter, Olivia White, and Cherilyn (Liv) Wright.  

Working from their discussions, Khadijah Akeem, Nelson Luna, and Ansley Erickson developed tags for all items here, with guidance from [Archives for Black Lives](https://archivesforblacklives.files.wordpress.com/2019/10/ardr_final.pdf).

The project received support from Tina Campt through [Barnard College's Harlem Semester](https://africana.barnard.edu/harlem-semester), an action grant from [HumanitiesNY](https://humanitiesny.org/), the [Edmund W. Gordon Institute for Urban and Minority Education at Teachers College](https://iume.tc.columbia.edu/), and by the [Center on History and Education, Teachers College, Columbia University](https://www.tc.columbia.edu/che/).
