This we resolve to do, and we look forward three years from now, when we are being graduated. This we shall remmember, that It is not important to know (underlined) everything. However, it is important to know the value (underlined) of everything- to appreciate what we learn, and to apply- what we know. This symbol, this candle of knowledge shall ever be the talisman to light our way."
